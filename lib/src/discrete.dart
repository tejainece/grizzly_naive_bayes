        This method is expected to be called several times consecutively
        on different chunks of a dataset so as to implement out-of-core
        or online learning.
        This is especially useful when the whole dataset is too big to fit in
        memory at once.
        This method has some performance overhead hence it is better to call
        partial_fit on chunks of data that are as large as possible
        (as long as fitting in the memory budget) to hide the overhead.
        Parameters
        ----------
        X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape = [n_samples, n_features]
            Training vectors, where n_samples is the number of samples and
            n_features is the number of features.
        y : array-like, shape = [n_samples]
            Target values.
        classes : array-like, shape = [n_classes] (default=None)
            List of all the classes that can possibly appear in the y vector.
            Must be provided at the first call to partial_fit, can be omitted
            in subsequent calls.
        sample_weight : array-like, shape = [n_samples] (default=None)
            Weights applied to individual samples (1. for unweighted).
        Returns
        -------
        self : object
            Returns self.
